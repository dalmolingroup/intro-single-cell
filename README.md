# Single-cell RNA-seq introduction course

This course covers the basics of single-cell RNA-seq analysis. This material was meant to be continuously improved by the students from the Dalmolin Systems Biology Group.  

This book is based on the following references:

- The experimental design of single-cell studies: [Tutorial: guidelines for the experimental design of single-cell RNA sequencing studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0073-y)
- [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor - Basics](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.13/OSCA.basic/);
- [Single-cell best practices](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/preamble.html)

# Install R packages using conda or mamba

Note the `environment.yml` file. It has a list of R packages that are going to be used in this course. Install them by:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the `intro-single-cell` environment:
```
conda activate intro-single-cell
```

# Download the data
